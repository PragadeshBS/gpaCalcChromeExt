## Privacy and other technical details
#### TL;DR - No collection or sharing of personal information.
The extension reads the DOM only on the *Attendance & Marks* section in your SEMS dashboard, specifically on the url *acoe.annauniv.edu/sems/student/mark*. This is done to get the semester, the subjects for that specific semester and your grades for those subjects. The extension then performs the necessary calculations locally on your machine. It does not transmit / receive any data over the network. This tool being a FOSS, you have the ability to verify the above for yourself. Only you can see your grades.  :cat:
